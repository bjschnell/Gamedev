S\-E\-N\-G 330 Group 10 Project Repository. Turn-\/based 2-\/player game -\/ name to be chosen.

\subsection*{Setup\-: }

We will be using Python 2.\-7, and Py\-Game. Follow download/setup instructions at \href{http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html}{\tt http\-://www.\-pygame.\-org/hifi.\-html}.

I have personally chosen to develop on Linux, and use virtualenv to create an isolated environment for this specific project. You can read about virtualenv here\-: \href{http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/}{\tt http\-://docs.\-python-\/guide.\-org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/}. But virtualenv is not necessary, and the project should work on Mac Windows or Linux.

Once you have cloned this project and have Py\-Game installed, try running game.\-py with the Python 2.\-7 interpreter.
