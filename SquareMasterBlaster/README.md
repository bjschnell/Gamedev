# SENG330
SENG 330 Group 10 Project Repository. Turn-based 2-player game - name to be chosen.

Setup:
------

We will be using Python 2.7, and PyGame. Follow download/setup instructions at http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html.

I have personally chosen to develop on Linux, and use virtualenv to create an isolated environment for this
specific project. You can read about virtualenv here: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/.
But virtualenv is not necessary, and the project should work on Mac Windows or Linux.

Once you have cloned this project and have PyGame installed, try running game.py with the Python 2.7 interpreter.
